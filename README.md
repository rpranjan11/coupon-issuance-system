# coupon-issuance-system
A coupon issuance system that enables creating campaigns with configurable parameters. Each campaign specifies the number of available coupons and a specific start date and time when coupons can be issued on a first-come-first-served basis. The programming language used to do this project is "GO". This is my first ever Go-language project.
